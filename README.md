# Project Name

## Overview
Mental Number Line (MNL) is a project aimed at understanding and visualizing the concept of the mental number line, which is a cognitive representation of numbers in a spatial format. This project includes tools for evaluating and analyzing numerical cognition and spatial representation of numbers. We define several metrics to evaluate whether the LLMs exhibit a representation of numbers that mirrors human MNL.


## Generate embeddings and compute metrics
Instructions on how to use the project.

To generate embeddings and compute metrics, update the models and other settings in the eval.sh. And run

```bash
sh eval.sh
```

## Evaluation on task performance
To evaluate the performance of LLMs on numeircal tasks and update settings according to requirement in the task_eval.sh

```bash
sh task_eval.sh
```
